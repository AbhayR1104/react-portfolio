        <p>
          As a Computer Science graduate student at Stony Brook University, I thrive on transforming complex operational challenges into streamlined, data-driven solutions. My experience in analyzing global procurement data at Hewlett Packard Enterprise honed my skills in identifying bottlenecks and creating impactful data models that reduce costs and improve efficiency. I am passionate about leveraging big data technologies and machine learning to build robust systems that not only perform but also deliver measurable business value.
